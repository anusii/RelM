# RelM
Implementations of differentially private Rel(ease) M(echanisms).

## Install

First of all, install rust: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html.

Then:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/anusii/differential-privacy
$ cd differential-privacy
$ pip install .
```

That's it!

## Run tests

Install the test dependencies:

```
pip install .[tests]
```

Check the tests run:

```
$ pytest tests
```


## Build docs

Install the docs dependencies:

```
$ pip install .[docs]
```

Build the docs:

```
sphinx-build -b html docs-source docs-build
```

The docs will now be in `docs-build/index.html`.

## Basic Usage
Read the raw data:
```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("pcr_testing_age_group_2020-03-09.csv")
```

Compute the exact query responses:
```python
exact_counts = data["age_group"].value_counts().sort_index()
```

Create a differentially private release mechanism:
```python
from relm.mechanisms import GeometricMechanism
mechanism = GeometricMechanism(epsilon=0.1, sensitivity=1.0)
```

Compute perturbed query responses:
```python
perturbed_counts = mechanism.release(values=exact_counts.values)
```

Differentially private release mechanisms are one-time use only:
```python
mechanism = GeometricMechanism(epsilon=0.1, sensitivity=1.0)
perturbed_counts = mechanism.release(values=exact_counts.values) # OK
perturbed_counts2 = mechanism.release(values=exact_counts.values) # Exception!
  # RuntimeError: Mechanism has exhausted has exhausted its privacy budget.
```

Each release requires its own differentially private release mechanism.
```python
mechanism = GeometricMechanism(epsilon=0.1, sensitivity=1.0)
perturbed_counts = mechanism.release(values=exact_counts.values) # OK
mechanism2 = GeometricMechanism(epsilon=0.1, sensitivity=1.0)
perturbed_counts2 = mechanism2.release(values=exact_counts.values) # OK
```
